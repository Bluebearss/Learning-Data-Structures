DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEMS AND HOW TO RUN THEM
This is my second HW. This HW is done in the programming language Java in the IDE Eclipse. The java files are all under one project.

The first problem is Clean up Friend List problem. The code is done using the Node and LinkedList class I made. The tester class itself has
helper methods that help run the bucketize function. To test this class, I manually made the objects and tested. I did not have time to
make it read off of a text file.

The second problem is the TeamSelect problem. I used the Node and LinkedList class to make this. To run this I made the in2.txt file, which
follows the Sample Input given in the homework. I then used Scanner to read off the text and put it into my code to execute it. I attached
the template I used for in2.txt.

The third problem is the LeakyStack problem. I made a stack class and test class, but I altered push to follow the conditions. I ran this 
by making the in3.txt file and followed the Sample Input in the homework with Scanner. I attached the template for in3.txt I used.

The fourth problem is the JohnvsTheNightKing problem. I implemented this problem using my Queue class and WhiteWalker class. To run this
I made a tester class which took in a in4.txt file. I followed the Sample Input in the homework with Scanner. I attached the template for
in4.txt I used.
